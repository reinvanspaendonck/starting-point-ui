# Starting Point UI

An open-source component library for Tailwind CSS. Inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), Starting Point UI gives you the same beautiful design system without locking you into a framework. React, Vue, Angular, Django, Laravel, Rails, plain HTML - if it runs Tailwind, it works.

## Features

- **Framework-agnostic** - works with any web stack. Build with React, Vue, Laravel, plain HTML, or anything else that supports Tailwind
- **Easy to use** - add classes like `btn`, `card`, or `input` and you're done
- **Accessible** - built with WAI-ARIA patterns, keyboard navigation, and focus management
- **Dark mode** - works out of the box with Tailwind's dark mode
- **Themeable** - easy to customize and make your own, follows the same theming principles as shadcn/ui
- **Lightweight** - just CSS and a small JavaScript module for interactive components
- **Clean markup** - readable class names, no class soup

## Components

Beautiful components for building complete interfaces:

Accordion, Avatar, Badge, Breadcrumb, Button, Button Group, Card, Checkbox, Collapsible, Combobox, Dialog, Dropdown, Field, Input, Input Group, Label, Pagination, Popover, Radio Group, Resizable, Select, Separator, Sheet, Sidebar, Slider, Switch, Table, Tabs, Textarea, Tooltip

## Quick Start

Install the package:

```bash
npm install starting-point-ui
```

Add the import to your CSS file:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "starting-point-ui";
```

Use components in your markup:

```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">Get Started</button>
```

For interactive components (dialogs, dropdowns, tabs, etc.), add the JavaScript:

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/starting-point-ui@0.24.1"
  type="module"
></script>
```

Or import it in your bundler:

```js
import "starting-point-ui";
```

## Philosophy

Starting Point UI is designed to be the first thing you install in any new project. Regardless of what you're building or what framework you choose, the components are always the same - so you can start every project from the same familiar foundation.
